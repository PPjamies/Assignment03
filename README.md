I Change most of the original file to follow an MVC model. I moved the GUI into the view class, the action events into the controller class, and the database into the model class.

The following were refactored due to code smells:
1. fields were not encapsulated
2. field names were not self-explanatory
3. undo() method was deadcode 
4. the whole programm was jammed into one class. 

Open Recent File does not work, I couldn't figure it out.
